Q1) Write a program that asks the user to input a number and prints whether the number is positive.
a = int(input("Enter a number : "))
if (a>0) :
    print("number is positive")
else :
    print("Number is negative")

Q2) Write a program that asks the user to input a number and prints whether the number is positive and even, positive and odd, or negative.

a = int(input("Enter a number : "))
if(a>0) :
    if(a%2==0) :
        print("Number is positive and even")
    else :
        print("Number is positive and odd")
else :
    print("Number is negative")

Q3) Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
for i in range(0,10) :
    print(i+1)

Q4) Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
i = 0
while i<10 :
    print(i+1)
    i = i+1

Q5) Write a program that prints a 5x5 grid of asterisks (*) using nested loops.
for i in range(0,5):
    for j in range(0,5):
        print("* ", end = "")
    print()

Q6) Write a program to check whether a year is a leap year or not?
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
# Check leap year conditions
if (year % 4 == 0):
    if (year % 100 == 0):
        if (year % 400 == 0):
            print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
        else:
            print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")


Q7) Check whether a number is prime or not.

# Take input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Check if number is greater than 1
if num > 1:
    # Check for factors
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
            break
    else:
        # If no factors found
        print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")

Q8) Given a range of numbers, find all the prime numbers within that range.

# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Take input from user
start = int(input("Enter the start of range: "))
end = int(input("Enter the end of range: "))

print(f"Prime numbers between {start} and {end} are:")

# Loop through range and print primes
for num in range(start, end + 1):
    if is_prime(num):
        print(num, end=" ")


Q9) Remove duplicates from the Array

arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_arr = []
for num in arr:
    if num not in unique_arr:
        unique_arr.append(num)
print(unique_arr)
